The stability of the ten photodiodes used to survey the \laser~light is monitored with a LED signal. The light is also transmitted to a reference photodiode for normalization. This reference photodiode is itself monitor thanks to a radioactive source.\\
A view of the PHOCAL box is given on figure \ref{fig:lasphocal}. It is comprised of:
\begin{itemize}
\item LED box: houses the LED itself and an LED driver that provides a pulsed signal lasting 10 ns with an intensity that may be tweaked manually thanks to a potentiometer between 20 and 20 V.
\item reference box: 
\item Logic board:
\item optics fibers and light mixers
\end{itemize}
