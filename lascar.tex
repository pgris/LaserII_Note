The LASCAR (LASer CAlibration Rod) card (Fig. \ref{fig:laslascar}) is a masterpiece of the LASERII electronics scheme. This innovative board aims at controlling the \las~system thanks to the following components:
\begin{itemize}

\item digitization through a charge analog-to-digital converter (QDC)

\item charge injection (LILAS) to monitor the stability of the electronics (photodiode preamplifiers)

\item time-to-digital converter (TDC) to estimate the time response of the \las~as a function of its intensity

\item TTCRX : chip used to retrieve LHC signals

\item HOLA card : sends data fragments 

\item LASER interface : to drive the \las~(power, trigger)

\end{itemize}

The LASCAR card is housed in a VME crate and its adress is in the format A32/D32. The heart is composed of an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Cyclone V manufactured by ALTERA \cite{altera-cyclone}.

The following inputs-outputs (Fig. \ref{fig:laslascarlinks}) are available :
\begin{itemize}
\item 16 analogic channels (differential mode) for the QDC
\item 4 digital entries (NIM format)
\item 2 analogic entries for the photomultipliers
\item 8 digital outputs (NIM format)
\item 1 analogic-digital interface with the \las
\item one fiber (entry) to get information from the TTC
\item one fiber (input-output) for acquisition
\item one ethernet link for the DCS
\item one interface with the VME bus
\item one JTAG interface to configure the FPGA

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{QDC}

The QDC of the LASCAR module (Fig. \ref{fig:laslascarqdc}) comprises 32 channels, each with a 14-bit, high speed, low power, successive approximation ADC that operates from a single 2.5 V power supply and features throughput rates of up to 4.2 MSPS. Each channel contains two ADCs, each preceded by a low noise, wide bandwidth track-and-hold circuit that can handle input frequencies in excess of 110 MHz. This part is preceded by two charge amplifier with different slopes (x1 and x4). The analog signal at the entrance of the QDC is integrated during 500 ns (adjustable through a VME register) and the maximum charge that may be integrated is of about 2000 pC. Analog signals that are to be converted arise from the eleven photodiodes, the two PMTs, and from the charge injection system (3 channels, one internal to the QDC, and 2 from the photodiode box).

\paragraph{LILAS}
The LILAS part of LASCAR (Fig. \ref{fig:laslascarlilas}) aims at injecting a known charge in each photodiode preamplifier so as to survey the linearity and the stability with time. The charge is injected in the system through three ways : a direct link to one of the QDC channels (since the QDC and LILAS are located on the same printed board), and two lemo cables plugged in the photodiode box and in Phocal.

\paragraph{TDC}
The LASCAR TDC (Fig. \ref{fig:laslascartdc}) is a TDC-GP1, an integrated device manufactured by ACAM. It contains two measuring channels with a typical resolution of 280 ps. This TDC aims at measuring the \las~time response as a function of its power. The time response as a function of the intensity has been measured for the \las~we are using (Fig. \ref{fig:lasresponse}). Values around 420 ps are observed for lower intensities and a decrease to 320 ps is seen for higher intensities. LASCAR is equipped with a delay system so as to to send the \las~light in an "empty" bunch-crossing in a coherent way during the physics runs of the LHC.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{TTCRX}

The TTCRX is an integrated circuit developped at CERN that retrieves the following LHC signals :
\begin{itemize}
\item Bunch Crossing (BC)
\item Bunch Crossing Reset (BCR)
\item Event Counter Reset (ECR)
\item Level one Accept (L1A)
\item Level one Identity (L1AID)
\end{itemize}

The FPGA will process these data prior to  a transmission to the TDAQ.

\paragraph{HOLA}

The HOLA card has been developed at CERN and is mounted on LASCAR. It is used for sending data fragments to the Read Out Buffer (ROB) via an optical fiber for each L1A.

\paragraph{LASER interface}

This mixed interface (analog and digital) is used to control the LASER J40-BL6S. The LASER intensity is set with an analog voltage (from 0 to 4V) and the trigger part is done through a TTL signal.

\paragraph{Acquisition modes}

There are two independent ways of running the \laser~system : the standalone mode and the "ATLAS TDAQ" mode.

\begin{itemize}

\item Standalone mode

The standalone mode may be used to check that the \laser~system is responding as expected. Reference runs may be performed so as to monitor the stability of the system. The control interface of the QDC and of the TDC is done with the VME bus and the running frequency reaches about 100 Hz. The following possible modes are:
\begin{itemize}

\item Pedestal : to measure of the QDC output distributions when no input signal is injected. Pedestal values are subtracted when results from other modes (Alpha, LED, Linearity, LASER) are studied.

\item Alpha : to estimate the response of the PHOCAL photodiode to alpha particles emitted by the Americium source. 

\item LED : the LED signal is transmitted to all the photodiodes via optical fibers. In this mode  the stability of the ten photodiodes used to monitor the \laser~light may be surveyed.

\item Linearity : a known charge is injected in the preamplifiers of the photodiodes so as to estimate the linearity and the stability of the electronics. 

\item LASER : LASER signals with varying intensities are sent in the system. The light may or may not be transmitted to the TileCal PMTs, depending on the status of the shutter located inside the optics box.

\end{itemize}

-> Data format ? Location of the Data ? GUI interface ?

\item ATLAS TDAQ mode

This mode is used in two ways: twice a week when calibration runs are performed and during physics runs, when \laser~pulses are emitted in empty bunch-crossings (every second). The control interface is provided by the SHAFT electronic module which sends requests to LASCAR. Output data fragments are tranmitted via the HOLA card for each L1A and \laser~Trigger Type.

The modes available are the same as in the standalone : Pedestal, Alpha, LED, Linearity, \laser. One possibility has been added. The "combined" mode consists in running Pedestal, LED and Alpha modes in a row. For each mode, the sum of the output values ($\Sigma$X) and of their squares ($\Sigma$X$^{2}$) are calculated and stored in a RAM. These values are then trasmitted in a data fragment (through the HOLA card for each L1A and \laser~Trigger Type) when the \laser~mode is activated.
