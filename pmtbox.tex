The PMT box (Fig. xx) comprehends two PMTs used to trigger the \laserii~acquisition in the LASER mode. It houses two electronic boards :
\begin{itemize}

\item \licpmt (Fig. \ref{fig:laslicpmt}) : this module is used to set the high voltage to the two PMTs located in the box. It provides measurements of temperature and humidity inside of the optics box and is used to manage the interlock chain that prevents users from flashing the \laser~when the optics box is open. LicPMT is also implied in the configuration and the control of the laser pump (slow control part) and is used to switch the \laser~pump (power supply relay) on.

\item \licmot~(Fig. \ref{fig:laslicmot}) : this module is used to drive the shutter and the two filter wheels (one at a time) that are located in the optics box. The choice between the two wheels is carried out as follows : the home-made wheel is activated when the wheel position board is connected to the \licmot~card. Otherwise, the Newport wheel is in use.
