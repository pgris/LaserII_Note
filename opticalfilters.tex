A patch panel of optical filters has been setup to cope with variations of \laser~light transmission at the ouput of the mixers (after the \laser~head, after the filter wheel, and at the output of the beam expander). It is thus possible, for each of the ten photodiodes that measures the \laser~signal, to insert an half-inch optical filter with a given attenuation. These filters are housed in PMMA blocks easy to open with manual screwing/unscrewing. Absortive neutral density filters have been inserted (see optical densities in table \ref{tab:filterod}).
